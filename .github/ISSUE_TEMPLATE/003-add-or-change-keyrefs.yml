          Assess how the keyref change affects other doc subcollections. Search the `cloud-docs` and `cloud-docs-solutions` orgs for the keyrefs that you are changing. Uses of your keyref are displayed on the Code tab.

          For example:

          - https://github.ibm.com/search?q=org%3Acloud-docs+openshiftshort&type=code
          - https://github.ibm.com/search?q=org%3Acloud-docs-solutions+openshiftshort&type=code

          If it's a commonly used keyref or this is a significant change, contact teams directly. The IBM Cloud docs team can help you identify the teams.
