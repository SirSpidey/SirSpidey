        Use this template to request a repo for new public or internal content in IBM Cloud docs.

      label: "The type of docs you will publish"
      description: Are you delivering public product docs for services or software, or internal-only content? If your service docs will ever go public with your product, choose external. External docs are common. Internal-only docs are added to a separate org, and your content will never be available to non-IBMers.
      options:
        - External docs for a managed IBM Cloud service (default).
        - External docs for a software product on IBM Cloud.
        - Internal-only docs.
        - Internal-only guidance docs. For example, a developer guide.

      description: If your docs are associated with a product on IBM Cloud, identify its `service-name`. To find your service-name, search https://globalcatalog.test.cloud.ibm.com/search and use the value in the `Name` column. This value is used as your repo name and will be part of your docs URL.
