        Are you delivering public product docs for services or software, or internal-only content?

        - If your service docs will be publicly available at some point, choose one of the **External** options.
            - Service docs example: [Virtual server for VPC](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc)
            - Software product docs example: [Power Virtual Server for SAP HANA](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sap-powervs).
        - If your content will never be available to non-IBMers, chose **Internal-only**.
            - Example internal-only docs: [Supplier Management Framework](https://test.cloud.ibm.com/docs-internal/supplier-mgmt-framework).
            - Internal-only guides are for internal guidance, such as a developer guide. Example: [Developing in IBM Cloud](https://test.cloud.ibm.com/docs-internal/get-coding).
      options:
        - Docs for an IBM Cloud service (External)
        - Docs for an IBM Cloud software product (External)
        - Internal-only docs
        - Guides (Internal-only)
