        Use this template to request a repo for new public or internal content in IBM Cloud docs.

        Make sure you update `<my service>` in **Add a title**.

        Are you delivering public product docs for services or software, or internal-only content?

        - If your service docs ever will be publicly available, choose external.

            - Example service docs: [Virtual server for VPC](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc)
            - Example software docs: [Power Virtual Server for SAP HANA](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sap-powervs).
        - Internal-only docs are added to a separate org, and your content will never be available to non-IBMers. Example: [Supplier Management Framework](https://test.cloud.ibm.com/docs-internal/supplier-mgmt-framework).
            - Guidance docs are collections such as developer guides. Example: [Developing in IBM Cloud](https://test.cloud.ibm.com/docs-internal/get-coding).
      options:
        - External docs for an IBM Cloud service (default)
        - External docs for an IBM Cloud software product
        - Internal-only docs
        - Internal-only guides
