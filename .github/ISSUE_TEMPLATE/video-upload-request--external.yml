        Use this template to request permission to upload an externally available video about IBM Cloud to the [IBM Cloud platform channel on IBM MediaCenter](https://mediacenter.ibm.com/channel/IBM%2BCloud%2Bplatform/338431352). If yours is a concept or demo video, it can be cross-posted by the team to YouTube.

        For more information about best practices and requirements, see [Creating videos](https://test.cloud.ibm.com/docs-internal/writing?topic=writing-creating-videos) in the content development guide.

        :information_source: **Tip:** If the video is meant only for IBMers, open a [Video upload request - internal](https://github.ibm.com/cloud-content/videos/issues/new/choose) issue instead.
